                                    Humanity is all about being human and not inhuman. It means living with emotions and
                                    intelligence.
                                    What may not be widely known is, what is meant by living with emotions and
                                    intelligence.
                                    Let me share my views on the subject. <br><br>

                                    Humanity is all about feeling love and compassion for others, for other people,
                                    be they relatives or even people who are distant from our life. Its a feeling of
                                    love
                                    and compassion for everyone,
                                    irrespective of religion, caste and creed, irrespective of nationality, and even for
                                    our
                                    enemies. Matters like religion, caste,
                                    creed and nationality often separate people and do not unite them. According to me,
                                    the
                                    way they are practised and lived,
                                    they have become enemies of humanity. Humanity is living a noble and caring life, as
                                    it
                                    is written in the Bible “In everything,
                                    then, do to others as you would have them do to you” [Matthew 7:12] (Please note: I
                                    am
                                    not refferring to masochists, as neither
                                    masochists nor saddists can be said to be human). And, as Jesus had said, “Thou
                                    shalt
                                    love thy neighbour as thyself.” This sums up
                                    what humanity is, in a nutshell. <br><br>

                                    Humanity, however, is much more than that. The feeling of love and compassion is not
                                    just for human beings, but also for plants and
                                    animals (for the entire vegetable and animal kingdom) and also for the environment
                                    in
                                    which we live. <br><br>

                                    Humanity means radiating love and care for all life on this planet, and even for the
                                    planet in which we live. Only then we can say we
                                    belong to humanity. Unfortunately, many of us have alienated ourselves from
                                    humanity. We
                                    have become inhuman in many ways.
